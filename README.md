## Available Tools

### Core Analysis Tools

#### `load_codebase`
Load an entire project into Gemini's context with intelligent prioritization:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__load_codebase
  project_path: "/path/to/your/project"
  max_tokens: 900000  # optional, default: 900000
```

#### `analyze_architecture`
Get comprehensive architecture analysis:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__analyze_architecture
  focus: "architecture"  # or "patterns", "dependencies", "structure"
```

#### `semantic_search`
Search your codebase using natural language:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__semantic_search
  query: "Find functions that handle user authentication"
```

#### `suggest_improvements`
Get targeted improvement suggestions:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__suggest_improvements
  area: "security"  # or "performance", "maintainability", "testing"
```

#### `explain_codeflow`
Trace how functionality works across your codebase:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__explain_codeflow
  functionality: "How user registration works from API to database"
```

#### `codebase_summary`
Get a comprehensive project overview:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__codebase_summary
```

#### `ask_with_context`
Ask any question about your loaded codebase:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__ask_with_context
  question: "What security vulnerabilities exist in the authentication system?"
```

### Session Management Tools

#### `export_session`
Export cached analysis results to a markdown file:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__export_session
  export_path: "/path/to/export"  # optional, defaults to project path
```

#### `session_stats`
Get current session cache statistics:
```bash
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__session_stats
```

## Session Caching

The enhanced server includes intelligent session caching to improve performance:

- **Automatic Caching**: Analysis results are cached for 30 minutes
- **Smart Invalidation**: Cache clears when switching projects
- **Performance Boost**: Repeated queries return instantly from cache
- **Export Capability**: Save important findings before they expire

### Caching Benefits
1. **Faster Iterations**: Re-run analyses without waiting
2. **Token Savings**: Avoid redundant API calls to Gemini
3. **Persistent Insights**: Export sessions for long-term reference

## Usage Examples

### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Load your project
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__load_codebase
  project_path: "/home/user/my-app"

# Get architecture overview
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__analyze_architecture

# Find specific functionality
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__semantic_search
  query: "payment processing logic"

# Get security improvements
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__suggest_improvements
  area: "security"

# Ask specific questions
mcp__gemini-collab-enhanced__ask_with_context
  question: "How can I optimize the database queries in the user service?"
```

## How It Works

### Intelligent File Prioritization
The server uses a sophisticated scoring system to determine which files are most relevant:

- **Language weights** - Core languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) get higher priority
- **Directory importance** - `src/`, `lib/`, `core/` directories are prioritized
- **File size optimization** - Balances completeness with context limits
- **Special files** - `main.py`, `index.js`, `app.py` get bonus priority

### Smart Token Management
- Uses `tiktoken` for accurate token counting
- Stays within Gemini's 1M token limit intelligently
- Fallback estimation when tiktoken unavailable
- Structured context formatting for optimal analysis

### Context Creation
Creates comprehensive context including:
- File tree structure with metadata
- Complete file contents with syntax highlighting
- Relevance scores and language detection
- Project statistics and organization

## Technical Details

### Supported File Types
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Scala
- **Web**: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Vue, Svelte, React (JSX/TSX)
- **Config**: JSON, YAML, XML, Dockerfile, Terraform
- **Documentation**: Markdown, SQL scripts

### Performance Features
- Intelligent file filtering (skips `node_modules`, `.git`, `__pycache__`, etc.)
- Relevance-based file selection
- Token-aware content loading
- Efficient context creation

## Installation Details

The enhanced server is installed at: `~/.claude-mcp-servers/gemini-collab-enhanced/`

### File Structure
```
~/.claude-mcp-servers/gemini-collab-enhanced/
├── enhanced_server.py      # Main server with intelligent analysis
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── test_enhanced.py       # Test suite
```

## Troubleshooting

**Server not showing up?**
```bash
# Check installation
claude mcp list

# Reinstall if needed
claude mcp remove gemini-collab-enhanced
./enhanced_setup.sh
```

**Token counting issues?**
```bash
# Install tiktoken for accurate counting
pip install tiktoken>=0.5.1
```

**Large codebase not loading completely?**
- Increase `max_tokens` parameter
- Check file relevance scores
- Exclude unnecessary directories

**Connection errors?**
- Verify Gemini API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Ensure dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`



## Best Practices

### For Large Codebases
- Start with architectural analysis
- Use semantic search to find specific areas
- Focus improvement suggestions on specific areas
- Break down complex questions into smaller parts

### For Security Analysis
1. Load codebase
2. Run security-focused improvements
3. Use semantic search for auth/validation code
4. Ask specific security questions with context

### For Performance Optimization
1. Analyze architecture first
2. Search for performance-critical code
3. Get performance-focused suggestions
4. Trace code flow for bottlenecks
